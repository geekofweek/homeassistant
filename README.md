# Overview
My personal [Home Assistant Container](https://home-assistant.io) configurations with 800+ automations.  These are my active automations and configurations that I use every day.  Updated frequently as I add more devices and come up with more and more complicated ways to do simple tasks.

| [Aeotec Z-Stick 7](https://amzn.to/3xQXuA4)| 1 | USB | [Z-Wave JS](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/) | Used to control all Z-Wave Devices.  Integrated via zwavejs2mqtt container |
| [Lutron Smart Bridge 2 Pro](https://amzn.to/2WLpKEF)| 1 | Ethernet | [Lutron Caséta](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/lutron_caseta) | Controls Lutron Caseta light switches, dimmers, and Pico remotes |
| [Bond Home](https://amzn.to/3i7dLds)| 1 | Wi-Fi | [Bond Home](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bond/) | Controls ceiling fans and lights via RF remote control commands.  Existing fans are each wired to a single switch that controls both power and light with fan and light controls done via a physical remote.  The Bond Home Hub allowed for sending of those RF remote commands via the hub and the local API makes it possible to send said commands from Home Assistant. |


Relevant hub configurations can be found within [configuration.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/configuration.yaml)

I utilize a number of automations that adjust climate controls.  Mostly they can be found in [climate.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/climate.yaml). Ecobee room sensors are heavily used in [occupancy.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/occupancy.yaml) and as conditions in many automations

More detailed information on the ESPhome configuration can be found in [here](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/tree/master/esphome/garage_door_relay)

| [Kasa Smart Plug Power Strip](https://amzn.to/3rlYajd) | 3 | Wi-Fi | [TP-Link Kasa Smart](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tplink/) | Used to control various devices with energy monitoring |


Switches and outlets are used in various capacities, some are for lighting and some are for fans type devices.  [lights.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/lights.yaml) should have some good examples.

| [Schlage Connect Touchscreen Deadbolt](https://amzn.to/2KwXltd) | 3 | Z-Wave | [Z-Wave JS](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/) | Smart locks used in automations to auto lock / unlock doors |

Locks are used mostly as a way to lock / unlock doors based on locations, see [location.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/location.yaml) and [locks.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/locks.yaml) for some examples

| [GoControl Door/Window Sensor](https://amzn.to/2wOhLfn) | 3 | Z-Wave | [Z-Wave JS](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/) | Door sensors to detect if exterior doors have been opened / closed |

Door sensors, motion sensors, and the alarm siren are used in many different ways via [alarm.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/alarm.yaml).  I've also implemented some of the alarm functions as part of [water_works.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/water_works.yaml).

## <a name="voice">Voice Assistant</a>

| [Amazon Echo Show 5](https://amzn.to/3sPEh09) | 1 | Wi-Fi | [Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/) |Voice Assistant with display 

I go for native Echo integration wherever possible, but a few devices are not currently supported where I've had to implement some work arounds via Home Assistant Cloud (previously Emulated Hue).  Most of these are just exposed via an [input_boolean]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_boolean.yaml) and [customize.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/customize.yaml).  This allows the ability to have echo turn on or off an [input_boolean]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_boolean.yaml)  in turn triggering an automation.

I also utilized the [Amazon Alexa Media Player Custom Component](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player), mostly to pick up the timers into Home Assistant

Most media player based automations can be found in [media.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/media.yaml) and some Text to Speech (TTS) based automation in various automations.

Harmony Hubs work via a combination of [input_selects]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_select.yaml), [scripts]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/scripts.yaml), and automations in [media.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/media.yaml).

Since I don’t use the network equipment as my primary presence detection method most of the automation is around house guests via [location.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/location.yaml).  The main function of the network equipment is to be network equipment for my fiber internet service.

The iOS app is used for some notifications within various automations. The native iOS app is the main method of doing any location based automations via [location.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/location.yaml) and many of the conditions I use are based on presence detection of household members.
