Locks are used mostly as a way to lock / unlock doors based on locations, see [location.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/location.yaml) and [locks.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/locks.yaml) for some examples

## Security

| Device  | Quantity | Connection | Home Assistant | Notes |
| ------------- | :---: | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [GoControl Door/Window Sensor](https://amzn.to/2wOhLfn) | 3 | Wink Hub (Z-Wave) | [Wink Binary Sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.wink/) | Door sensors to detect if exterior doors have been opened / closed |
| [GoControl Siren and Strobe](https://amzn.to/2k4bK4U) | 1 | Wink Hub (Z-Wave) | [Wink Alarm](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/alarm_control_panel.wink/) | Alarm used for when alarm is triggered or when you want to get someone's attention|

Door sensors are used in many different ways. I trigger on them via [doors.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/doors.yaml), use them for security in [security.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/security.yaml), and as various conditions in [notification_audio.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/notification_audio.yaml) and [climate.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/climate.yaml).
The alarm siren is used in [security.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/security.yaml) and in the security [scene](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/scenes.yaml). I've also implemented the alarm as part of [water_sensors.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/water_sensors.yaml).

## Voice Assistant

| Device  | Quantity | Connection | Home Assistant | Notes |
| ------------- | :---: | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Amazon Echo](https://amzn.to/2KuPHjd) | 1 | Wi-Fi | [Emulated Hue Bridge](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/) | Audio only Voice Assistant |
| [Amazon Echo Dot](https://amzn.to/2wSreSW) | 6 | Wi-Fi | [Emulated Hue Bridge](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/) | Audio only Voice Assistant |
| [Amazon Echo Spot](https://amzn.to/2rOVZ6a) | 1 | Wi-Fi | [Emulated Hue Bridge](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/) | Voice Assistant with small display |
| [Amazon Echo Show](https://amzn.to/2rRhN0n) | 1 | Wi-Fi |  [Emulated Hue Bridge](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/) |Voice Assistant with display |

I go for native Echo integration wherever possible, but a few devices are not currently supported where I've had to implement some work arounds via emulated hue.  Most of these are just exposed via an [input_boolean]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_boolean.yaml) and [customize.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/customize.yaml).  This allows the ability to have echo turn on or off an [input_boolean]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_boolean.yaml)  in turn triggering an automation.

## Media

Most media player based automations can be found in [media.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/media.yaml) and some Text to Speech (TTS) based automation in [notification_audio.yaml
]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/notification_audio.yaml).

Harmony Hubs work via a combination of [input_selects]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_select.yaml), [scripts]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/scripts.yaml), and automations in [media.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/media.yaml).

## Sensors

| [Nest Protect v2 Battery](https://amzn.to/2LJ0ACn) | 6 | Wi-Fi | [Nest](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/nest/) | Smoke Alarm and CO Alarm.  I realized most of my Smoke Alarms had long suprased the 10 year mark and it was time for some replacements. I usually avoid Google owned products for various reasons, but the Nest Protect line has high praise. |

Water sensors serve one major function, to alert me to the presence of water.  Almost all of those automations can be fond via [water_sensors.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/water_sensors.yaml)

## Cameras

Nothing is currently automated around cameras, just a [UI](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/images/camera-screenshot.jpg) element.  The Ring doorbell is used in a number of ways to trigger an action based on motion detection or someone ringing the doorbell.  Examples can be found in [doorbell.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/doorbell.yaml)

## Garage

Since I don’t use the network equipment as my primary presence detection method most of the automation is around house guests via [house_guest.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/house_guest.yaml).  The main function of the network equipment is to be network equipment for my fiber internet service.

| [Home Assistant Management Tool](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/tools/ha-mgmt-docker.sh) | 1 | Ethernet | NA | Custom Shell script for managing Home Assistant |

The iOS app is used for some notifications in [notification_text.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/notification_text.yaml). Locative is the main method of doing any location based automations via [location.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/location.yaml) and many of the conditions I use are based on presence detection of household members provided by Locative.

The [Home Assistant Management Tool](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/tools/ha-mgmt-docker.sh) is something I built for my personal use, but can easily be modified to suite different setups.  Adjust the variables to your settings and setup shared SSH keys (if desired).  Probably a million other more efficient ways to do this, but it has worked out so far for me.  I had a previous version that I was using before converting to a Docker based installation. That one works with a more traditional installation.  You can check out that version [here]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/tools/ha-mgmt.sh)

#### Overview:

- Bash Shell script, should work anywhere you can use Bash
- All HA configs are stored on my local workstation within Dropbox (doesn’t have to be but I like the versioning and access to it from any machine).
- Edit locally with Text Editor.  Currently using [Atom]( https://atom.io).

#### Options:

1.	Deploy Home Assistant Configs
    - Creates tar file of current configs
    - Backs up tar file to local workstation (I use a Dropbox Folder)
    - rsyncs config directory from local workstation (Dropbox Folder)
2.	Restart Home Assistant
    - Restarts the Home Assistant Docker container, thus restarting Home Assistant
3. 	Stop Home Assistant
    - Stops the Home Assistant Docker Container
4.	Start Home Assistant
    - Starts the Home Assistant Docker Container
5.	Upgrade Home Assistant
    - Does a docker pull for the latest version of Home Assistant
    - Stops the Home Assistant Docker Container
    - Deletes the Home Assistant Docker Container
    - Creates a new Home Assistant Docker Container
6.	Check Database Size
    - Check the size of the MySQL Database
7. 	Validate Home Assistant Config
    - Runs a config check using a Docker Container
8. 	Backup Home Assistant
    - Creates tar file of current configs
    - Backs up tar file to local workstation (Dropbox Folder)
9. 	Copy Configs to GitHub
    - Copy’s current config to local workstation Github, scrubs any data that is listed in [redacted.txt]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/tools/redacted.txt) using [ha-github-scrub.sh]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/tools/ha-github-scrub.sh).  
10.	Renew SSL Certificate
    - Runs a certbot (Let's Encrypt) Docker container that generates a new SSL certificate
